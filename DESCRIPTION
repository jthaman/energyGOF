Title: Goodness-of-Fit Tests for Univariate Data via Energy
Version: 0.1
Authors@R: person("John", "Haman", email = "mail@johnhaman.org", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description:  Conduct one- and two-sample goodness-of-fit tests for univariate data. In the one-sample case, normal, uniform, exponential, Bernoulli, binomial, geometric, beta, Poisson, lognormal, Laplace, asymmetric Laplace, inverse Gaussian, half-normal, chi-squared, gamma, F, Weibull, Cauchy, and Pareto distributions are supported. egof.test() can also test goodness-of-fit to any distribution with a continuous distribution function. A subset of the available distributions can be tested for the composite goodness-of-fit hypothesis, that is, one can test for distribution fit with unknown parameters. P-values are calculated via parametric bootstrap.
