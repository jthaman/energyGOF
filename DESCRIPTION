Title: Goodness-of-fit tests via the energy of data
Version: 0.1
Authors@R: person("John", "Haman", email = "mail@johnhaman.org", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: This package provides the energyGOF.test (alias: egof.test) function, which conducts one-sample goodness-of-fit tests for normal, uniform, exponential, Bernoulli, binomial, geometric, beta, Poisson, lognormal, laplace, asymmetric Laplace, inverse Gaussian, halfnormal, chi-squared, gamma, F, Weibull, Cauchy, and Pareto distributions. A subset of the available distributions can be tested for the composite goodness-of-fit hypothesis, that is, one can test for distribution fit with unknown parameters. P-values are calculated with parametric bootstrap.
