Description: This package provides the `energyfit.test` (alias: `ef.test`)
             function, which conducts one-sample goodness-of-fit tests for normal, uniform,
             exponential, bernoulli, binomial, geometric, beta, poisson, lognormal, laplace,
             asymmetriclaplace, inversegaussian, halfnormal, chisquared, gamma, weibull,
             cauchy, stable, and pareto distributions. A subset of the available
             distributions can be tested for the composite goodness-of-fit hypothesis, that
             is, one can test for distribution fit with unknown parameters.
