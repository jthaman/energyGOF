# Energyfit ⚡️

This package provides the `energyfit.test` (alias: `ef.test`) function, which conducts one-sample goodness-of-fit tests for normal, uniform, exponential, bernoulli, binomial, geometric,  beta, poisson, lognormal,  laplace,  asymmetriclaplace,  inversegaussian, halfnormal,  chisquared, gamma, weibull, cauchy, stable, and pareto distributions. A subset of the available distributions can be tested for the composite goodness-of-fit hypothesis, that is, one can test for distribution fit with unknown parameters.
