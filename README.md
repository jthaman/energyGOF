# EnergyGOF

This package provides the `energyGOF.test` (alias: `eg.test`) function, which conducts one-sample goodness-of-fit tests for parametric distributions, including normal, uniform, exponential, Bernoulli, binomial, geometric, beta, Poisson, lognormal, Laplace,  asymmetric Laplace,  inverse Gaussian, halfnormal,  chi-squared, gamma, F, Weibull, Cauchy, stable, and Pareto distributions. A subset of the available distributions can be tested for the composite goodness-of-fit hypothesis, that is, one can test for distribution fit with unknown parameters.
